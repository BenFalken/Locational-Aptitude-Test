# Locational-Aptitude-Test

A Matlab Psychotoolbox experiment regarding the effect of a user's perception of relative mass. For this program, a soccer ball is shown in 10 separate trials on 10 differently curved terrains. Users predict the furthest point reached for each trial.

Note: 

Some sections remain under development. Data Analysis is out of date for the time being.

Add a folder in this file labeled RollSurfaces. This will store the graphs for the trials in their own dedicated directory.

Change the path name from benfalken to the appropriate path.
